<!-- [START OF SECTION: Context] -->

## Context

ABC Home & Commercial, one of Texas's largest service providers, fields thousands of customer calls weekly. With a lean team handling the volume, inconsistent answers and long resolution times were dragging down efficiency. Leadership sought a smarter, scalable way to centralize knowledge and improve performance.

<!-- [START OF SECTION: Challenge] -->

## Challenge

CSRs lacked fast, reliable access to accurate information. Scattered docs and internal chats led to delays, mistakes, and missed upsells. Without a single source of truth, even seasoned reps struggled to keep up.

<!-- [END OF SECTION: Challenge] -->

---

<!-- [START OF SECTION: Solution] -->

## Solution

We built **Andi the Anteater**, an AI assistant in Google Chat that gives agents instant answers from a centralized knowledge base.

### Key Solution Components

- **Custom workflows** for error reporting & content updates
- **A data pipeline** linking Andi usage to 8x8 call metrics
- **Dashboards** (Rill + Snowflake) for tracking performance

### Key Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Error Rate Reduction** | ~90% | Reduction in AI error rates |
| **Quality Score** | 4/5 | Quality score achieved consistently |
| **Response Time** | <3s | Average response time |

### Impact Summary

Andi became the go-to tool for CSRs—cutting errors, boosting quality, and scaling from 5 to 25+ agents. Now core to daily ops, it's proving repeatable across sales, IT, and training.
