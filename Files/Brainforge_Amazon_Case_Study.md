<!-- [START OF SECTION: Context] -->

## Context

A fast-growing eCommerce brand needed structured insight into Amazon performance, but reporting efforts lacked alignment. Multiple teams built dashboards in isolation, with no shared ownership or agreement on key metrics. As a result, analytics became reactive—driven by stakeholder requests rather than strategy—making reporting high effort with low return.

<!-- [START OF SECTION: Challenge] -->

## Challenge

Without clear objectives or ownership, teams struggled to build dashboards that delivered real value. Different stakeholders pushed for conflicting metrics, planning was skipped, and KPIs weren't defined. The result: polished dashboards with low adoption, fragmented efforts, and no clear direction on what to scale or prioritize.

<!-- [START OF SECTION: Solution] -->

## Solution

To meet stakeholder needs, the team quickly delivered a segmented Amazon sales dashboard using Amplitude-style templates. While this sped up delivery, it exposed gaps in BI ownership, lacked business context, and revealed fragmented efforts with no intake process.

### Key Solution Components

- **Replicated Amplitude-style layout** to speed up delivery
- **Mapped and visualized Amazon sales** by segment
- **Context-driven BI** through structured discovery

<!-- [START OF SECTION: Results] -->

## Results

The dashboard rollout aligned teams on purpose over presentation, creating a repeatable BI model now used across marketing, finance, and ops. Every new dashboard starts with a discovery brief, follows a shared intake process, and delivers in two weeks—now the standard for all marketplace reporting and a required step in every BI project.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **3+ teams** | Alignment | Aligned under one BI intake process |
| **100%** | Adoption | New dashboards start with a discovery brief |
| **2-week** | Turnaround | From request to delivery |
