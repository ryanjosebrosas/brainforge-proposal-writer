## Methodology: Diagnose. Design. Deploy.

Brainforge delivers decision-ready data in weeks, not quarters, through a three-phase approach:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Diagnose** | Map KPIs, find data gaps, audit stack |
| **Design** | Warehouse schema, modeling standards, trust/observability guardrails |
| **Deploy** | Ship dbt models, ETL pipelines, and dashboards your teams actually use |

**Key Value Proposition:** Decision-ready data in weeks, not quarters.

## Data Trust Philosophy

**Core Principle:** "If you don't trust it, you won't use it."

2. **Fresh numbers you can rely on** - Real-time or near real-time data updates
3. **Save hours lost to reporting** - Automated dashboards and reporting workflows

**Primary Tools Used:**
- Snowflake (Data Warehouse)
- dbt (Data Transformation)
- Tableau (Visualization)

[START OF SECTION]
## Context

Eden is a healthcare/wellness company requiring sophisticated data infrastructure to track customer journeys, measure LTV:CAC, and enable operational visibility across their business.
[END OF SECTION]

[START OF SECTION]
## Challenge

With no unified data model, Eden relied on disconnected systems and stale exports. Delays surfaced only after complaints, segmentation was basic, and key operational data was locked in a rigid EMR, leaving teams without the visibility to act quickly or strategically.
[END OF SECTION]

**Technologies Implemented:**
- Polytomic (Data Movement)
- Segment (Customer Data Platform)
- Mixpanel (Product Analytics)
- Northbeam (Attribution)
- Tableau (Visualization)
- Braze (Marketing Automation)
- Google BigQuery (Data Warehouse)

> Image caption: Architecture diagram showing data sources (Northbeam, Google Sheets, Typeform, Zendesk, Shippo, Segment, Facebook Ads, Google Ads) flowing through transformation layer (dbt, Polytomic) to data warehouse (Google BigQuery, Brainforge transformations) and out to downstream tools (Mixpanel, Tableau, Customer.io, Facebook).
[END OF SECTION]

[START OF SECTION]
## Results

- **$20k reduction** in tooling spend
- **100% accurate benchmarks** for LTV:CAC
- **<15 minutes** to answer common data questions
