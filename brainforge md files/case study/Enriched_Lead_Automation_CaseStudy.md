# From Spray-and-Pray to Precision: Automating Account-Based Campaigns

## Context
[START OF SECTION]
Our client's Go-to-Market (GTM) team needed a better way to surface and engage high-intent leads. Manual targeting and flat campaigns let enterprise accounts slip through the cracks. The goal was to scale outreach without losing relevance or personalization.

The team was operating in the Sales & Marketing industry and required a solution that could handle the complexity of account-based marketing at scale while maintaining the quality of personalized engagement that enterprise prospects expect.

## Challenge
[START OF SECTION]
Spray-and-pray tactics weren't cutting it. The client faced several critical obstacles:

- Campaigns using generic lists saw **0% reply rates**
- Teams lacked real-time data on who to reach, what to say, or when to engage
- Manual processes slowed things down and left growth opportunities untouched
- No systematic way to identify and prioritize high-intent accounts
- Enterprise accounts were slipping through the cracks due to insufficient targeting
- List building consumed excessive time that could be spent on strategic activities
[END OF SECTION]

## Solution
[START OF SECTION]
Brainforge built an automated outbound engine that starts in HubSpot, enriches data in Clay, reviews it, and then pushes it back to HubSpot and out to campaigns via HeyReach.

### Key Components

**Data Enrichment Pipeline:**
- Enriched companies with revenue data, headquarters location, and ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) team members
- Integrated TheirStack for technology stack intelligence
- Used Apify for web scraping and data collection

**Lead Intelligence:**
- Captured engagement signals from LinkedIn to surface warm leads
- Implemented real-time intent signals to prioritize outreach timing

**Workflow Automation:**
- Automated flows kept HubSpot, Clay, and campaign tools aligned using n8n
- End-to-end automation from lead capture to email send
- Seamless data sync across all platforms in the stack

### Technology Stack
