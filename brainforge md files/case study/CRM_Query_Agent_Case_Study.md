# From Ad Hoc to Chat With Your CRM: Transform How You Track Engagement

## Context
[START OF SECTION]
The team needed a better way to track community referrals and Zoom event engagement. Everything lived in spreadsheets, forcing manual checks and slowing growth efforts. Insights were scattered, ad hoc, and hard to scale across GTM (go-to-market) teams.

**At a Glance:**
- **Project Type:** CRM Querying + Proactive Referral Nudges
- **Function:** Growth & Engagement
- **Project Duration:** 1 Month
- **Industry:** Sales & Marketing
- **Location:** Remote / USA-based

## Challenge
[START OF SECTION]
There was no easy way to answer questions like:
- Who attended?
- Who referred whom?
- Who needs a nudge?

Manual spreadsheet checks made it slow to follow up, while referral gaps went unnoticed and opportunity windows closed. The lack of real-time visibility into engagement data meant the team was always reactive rather than proactive, missing critical moments to nurture leads and acknowledge referral contributors.

- **Pulls structured data from Google Sheets:** Centralized data source for event attendance and referral tracking
- **Sends targeted weekly alerts:** Based on attendance and referral filters to prompt timely follow-ups
- **Architecture extensible:** Ready for email nudges or direct CRM updates as the system scales
