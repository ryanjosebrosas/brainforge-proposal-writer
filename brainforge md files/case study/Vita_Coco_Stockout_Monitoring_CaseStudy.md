# Vita Coco Real-Time Stockout Visibility System

[START OF SECTION]
## Context

Vita Coco, a leading natural beverage brand, lacked real-time visibility into Target retail stockouts. Manual checks and screenshots slowed reporting and left finance teams reactive. Without APIs or modern infrastructure, even brief shelf gaps led to revenue loss and inventory risk.

The company needed a scalable solution to monitor inventory status across their entire Target retail footprint—over 900 stores nationwide—without relying on fragmented, manual processes.

## Challenge

Vita Coco's retail teams had no scalable system for tracking stockouts at Target. The key challenges included:

- **No automated monitoring:** Manual checks and screenshots created gaps in visibility
- **Delayed replenishment cycles:** Lack of real-time data caused delayed responses to out-of-stock situations
- **Revenue exposure:** The business was exposed to avoidable revenue loss from empty shelves
- **Reactive decision-making:** Operational decisions were based on incomplete and inconsistent data
- **Legacy system constraints:** Without APIs or modern infrastructure, integration was complex

## Solution

Brainforge built a **real-time stock monitoring system**—extracting daily data from all Target stores using cloud automation and integrating seamlessly with legacy systems.

### Key Components

1. **Browser-based stock data extraction:** Automated web scraping using Browserbase and Firecrawl to pull inventory data directly from Target's retailer portal

2. **Cloud orchestration at national scale:** Zapier and Relevance AI workflows coordinated data collection across 900+ store locations daily

3. **Seamless SQL Server integration:** Direct connection to Vita Coco's existing SQL Server infrastructure for immediate data availability to finance and operations teams

4. **AI-powered data processing:** OpenAI integration for intelligent data parsing and anomaly detection

### Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Browserbase | Browser automation for web data extraction |
| Zapier | Workflow automation and orchestration |
| Relevance AI | AI agent coordination |
