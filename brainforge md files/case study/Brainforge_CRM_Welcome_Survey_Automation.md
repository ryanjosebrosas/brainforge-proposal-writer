# CRM Welcome + Survey Automation

## Context
[START OF SECTION]
The team was scaling a community-driven CRM funnel with multiple touchpoints—welcome emails, post-meeting surveys, and referral tracking—but lacked the automation to handle these at speed. Manual follow-ups slowed growth, and attendee data wasn't flowing cleanly into systems.

The goal was to create seamless engagement from the initial welcome through to referral capture, ensuring no leads fell through the cracks while eliminating manual overhead.

## Challenge
[START OF SECTION]
Every new CRM entry and event created extra lift for the team:

- Welcome emails had to be sent by hand for each new contact
- Survey links were shared manually post-meeting
- Follow-ups risked falling through the cracks without systematic tracking
- Engagement signals were missed due to lack of automation
- The CRM lacked reliable, enriched data for decision-making

Without automations in place, the team struggled to maintain consistent touchpoints while scaling their community-driven funnel.
[END OF SECTION]

## Solution
[START OF SECTION]
Brainforge built lightweight, modular automations that responded to user behavior—triggering personalized welcome emails, sending feedback surveys based on Zoom attendance, and flagging high-engagement leads after repeat visits.

**Key Implementation Components:**

1. **CRM-Triggered Welcome Emails:** Automated welcome sequences with referrer information included, triggered immediately upon new CRM entry

2. **Zoom Event Integration:** Zoom event data used to send targeted post-meeting surveys to attendees

3. **Attendance Threshold Logic:** Attendance thresholds triggered deeper outreach for repeat visitors, identifying high-engagement leads

4. **Low-Code Architecture:** All logic routed through Google Sheets + low-code automation platforms (n8n, Zapier)

**Technologies Deployed:**
- OpenAI for intelligent content personalization
- n8n for workflow orchestration
- Google Sheets as the central data hub
- Zapier for cross-platform integrations
- Zoom API for event attendance data
- Slack for team notifications and alerts

## Results
[START OF SECTION]
The automation implementation delivered measurable improvements across the entire CRM funnel:

| Metric | Improvement | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Funnel Velocity | **40% faster** | Due to consistent, timely outreach |
| Survey Engagement | **+50%** | Engagement with post-event surveys |
| Qualified Referrals | **2x increase** | Captured via automated journeys |

**Operational Impact:**
Consistent, personalized touchpoints are now automated across the funnel—no extra headcount required. Surveys, follow-ups, and CRM enrichment now run in the background, letting the team focus on growth.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Zero manual intervention required for standard welcome sequences
- Real-time lead scoring based on attendance patterns
- Automated referral tracking and attribution
- Scalable system ready for increased community growth
