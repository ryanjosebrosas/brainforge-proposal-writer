# Andi: The AI Agent Revolutionizing ABC Home's Call Center

[START OF SECTION]
## Context

ABC Home & Commercial, one of Texas's largest service providers, fields thousands of customer calls weekly. With a lean team handling the volume, inconsistent answers and long resolution times were dragging down efficiency. Leadership sought a smarter, scalable way to centralize knowledge and improve performance.

## Challenge

CSRs lacked fast, reliable access to accurate information. Scattered docs and internal chats led to delays, mistakes, and missed upsells. Without a single source of truth, even seasoned reps struggled to keep up.

Key pain points included:
- No centralized knowledge base for customer service representatives
- Inconsistent answers across the team
- Long resolution times impacting customer satisfaction
- Newer agents had steep learning curves
- Missed upsell opportunities due to information gaps
