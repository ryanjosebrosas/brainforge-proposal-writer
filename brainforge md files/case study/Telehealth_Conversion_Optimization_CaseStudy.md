# Unlocking Conversions in a Regulated Intake Funnel

## Context

[START OF SECTION]

A mid-market telehealth company faced high abandonment in its intake funnel, especially at sensitive steps like insurance and personal data collection. Limited analytics made it hard to pinpoint drop-offs, stalling conversion improvements and growth.

The company operates in the regulated consumer e-commerce space within healthcare, where compliance and user trust are critical factors in the conversion process. Without granular visibility into user behavior at each funnel step, the growth team was unable to identify optimization opportunities or run effective experiments.

## Challenge

[START OF SECTION]

Without question-level insights, the team couldn't see where users were leaving the intake funnel. This lack of visibility created several compounding problems:

- **Conversion stalled:** Unable to identify specific friction points in the user journey
- **Acquisition costs climbed:** Marketing spend was being wasted on traffic that abandoned mid-funnel
- **Revenue was lost:** High drop-off rates directly impacted bottom-line revenue
- **Compliance risk:** In a regulated space, failing to optimize the intake experience also risked eroding trust and compliance credibility with users

The team needed event-level analytics to understand exactly which questions and form fields were causing users to abandon, and the ability to connect this data to broader acquisition metrics.

## Solution

[START OF SECTION]

Brainforge partnered with the client to redesign and re-instrument the entire intake process, implementing a comprehensive analytics and optimization stack:

**1. Granular Tracking Implementation**
Deployed Mixpanel and Google Tag Manager for event-level visibility at every funnel step. This enabled the team to see exactly which questions users were abandoning on, how long they spent on each step, and where friction existed.

**2. Form Redesign**
Rebuilt the intake experience using embeddable forms to streamline transitions between steps and reduce cognitive load. The new forms were optimized for mobile, reduced the number of required fields, and provided clearer progress indicators.

**3. Full-Funnel Integration**
Connected funnel analytics to acquisition metrics including Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) for complete visibility from ad click to conversion. This allowed the team to understand which traffic sources produced the highest-quality conversions.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Mixpanel** - Event tracking and behavioral analytics
- **Segment** - Customer data platform for data routing
- **Tableau** - Visualization and reporting dashboards
- **BigQuery** - Data warehouse for analytics storage
- **Google Tag Manager** - Tag management and event instrumentation
