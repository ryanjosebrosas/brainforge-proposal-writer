# Customer Support Operations Dashboard using Gorgias

## Context
[START OF SECTION]
A mid-market subscription/DTC company faced rising support costs with little visibility into CX performance. The team used Gorgias for customer support management but lacked reporting capabilities to assess agents, resolution efficiency, or macro usage. This left leadership without the insights needed to optimize or automate operations.

**Company Profile:**
- Business Model: Subscription/DTC (Direct-to-Consumer)
- Market Segment: Mid-Market Consumer Subscription
- Support Platform: Gorgias
- Location: USA-based (Remote)
[END OF SECTION]

## Challenge
[START OF SECTION]
The company had no clear way to measure CX performance. Heavy reliance on manual agent work inflated costs, and without structured reporting, leadership couldn't spot inefficiencies or plan for automation. The lack of visibility kept the team reactive instead of proactive.

**Key Pain Points:**
- No structured reporting on agent performance
- Unable to assess resolution efficiency
- No visibility into macro usage effectiveness
- Rising support costs without accountability
- Leadership blind to optimization opportunities
- Reactive operations instead of proactive planning

## Results
[START OF SECTION]
After 3 months of implementation, the dashboard delivered significant operational insights:

- **>30% reduction** in agent workload identified as optimization opportunity
- **15% cost-per-query** baseline established for better budgeting and benchmarking
- **40% of tickets** flagged for optimization (top 10% driving outsized costs)

**Business Impact:**
The dashboard revealed a 30%+ workload reduction opportunity, set a cost-per-query baseline for better budgeting, and flagged the top 10% of tickets driving outsized costs—prompting leadership to explore deeper savings and automation initiatives.

**Outcomes Enabled:**
- Data-driven decisions on agent allocation
- Clear visibility into automation candidates
- Budget forecasting with cost-per-query benchmarks
- Proactive (vs. reactive) CX operations management
