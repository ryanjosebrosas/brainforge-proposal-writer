# Centralizing Customer Sentiment via Okendo Dashboard

[START OF SECTION]
## Context

A consumer goods brand needed better visibility into customer sentiment and product performance. Reviews were spread across web, Facebook, and Google, making it difficult for CX and product teams to track satisfaction or identify top performers.

The brand required a unified view of customer feedback without investing heavily in complex analytics infrastructure.

## Challenge

Without a centralized system, the team faced several critical issues:

- **Missed insights:** Fragmented review sources meant valuable customer feedback went unnoticed
- **Slower customer response:** Lack of consolidated data delayed reaction to emerging issues
- **Product blind spots:** Difficulty identifying top performers and underperforming SKUs
- **Leadership visibility gap:** Executives needed quick sentiment visibility without heavy analytics investment

The decentralized nature of reviews across web, Facebook, and Google created operational inefficiencies and prevented data-driven product decisions.
