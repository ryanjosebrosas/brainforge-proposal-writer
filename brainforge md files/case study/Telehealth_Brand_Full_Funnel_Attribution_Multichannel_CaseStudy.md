# Full-Funnel Attribution for Smarter Spend

[START OF SECTION]
## Context

A digitally native telehealth brand expanded from Meta and Google into TikTok, CTV, and affiliates. Reporting was CAC-only by channel with no product-level margin view, and 15–20% of media spend was unattributed. This put a seven-figure budget and leadership confidence at risk.

The company needed visibility into multi-channel performance to make informed budget allocation decisions across their growing advertising portfolio.

## Challenge

Rapid expansion created blind spots. Leadership lacked visibility into which channels and products drove profitable growth. Without a unified attribution model, budget decisions risked overspending and margin erosion.

Key pain points included:
- CAC-only reporting with no product-level margin visibility
- 15–20% of media spend remained unattributed
- Seven-figure budget at risk due to lack of clarity
- No unified view across Meta, Google, TikTok, CTV, and affiliate channels
- Leadership confidence eroding due to incomplete data

## Solution

Brainforge built a performance marketing attribution model that addressed all key gaps:

**1. Unified the Data Layer**
Standardized SKUs and delivered full CAC accounting across all channels. This eliminated the 15–20% unattributed spend and created a single source of truth for marketing performance.

**2. Optimized for Margin**
Integrated COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) data to shift spend decisions from CAC to contribution margin. This enabled the team to optimize for profitability rather than just acquisition cost.

**3. Enabled Real-Time Decisions**
Built dashboards and reporting infrastructure that provided real-time visibility into campaign performance, ultimately driving a >25% improvement in campaign efficiency.

**Technologies Used:**
- **BigQuery** – Cloud data warehouse for unified data storage
- **Polytomic** – Data sync and integration layer
- **Tableau** – Visualization and dashboard delivery
- **dbt** – Data transformation and modeling
