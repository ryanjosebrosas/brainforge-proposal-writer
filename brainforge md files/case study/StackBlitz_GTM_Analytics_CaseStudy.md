# How StackBlitz Hit Hypergrowth Goals with On-Demand Data Experts

## Context
[START OF SECTION]
StackBlitz is a fast-growing developer tools company behind the AI-powered Bolt.new integrated development environment (IDE). The company reached $40M in ARR just five months after launch, demonstrating explosive growth in the developer tools market.

However, without a centralized data stack, teams spent hours chasing answers. There was no reliable way to track critical business metrics such as churn, lifetime value (LTV), or feature usage—all essential for sustaining hypergrowth.

## Challenge
[START OF SECTION]
Without a central source of truth, Go-to-Market (GTM) and product teams at StackBlitz couldn't access consistent data or answer key questions quickly.

Key pain points included:

- Data scattered across disconnected tools with no unified view
- Teams stuck stitching together insights manually from multiple sources
- Slow decision-making due to lack of reliable, accessible data
- Eroding confidence in data accuracy and reporting
- No visibility into churn, LTV, or feature usage metrics
- Hours wasted chasing answers instead of executing on strategy
