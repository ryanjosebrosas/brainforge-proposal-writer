# Amazon Sales Reporting Dashboard

[START OF SECTION]
## Context

A fast-growing eCommerce brand needed structured insight into Amazon performance, but reporting efforts lacked alignment. Multiple teams built dashboards in isolation, with no shared ownership or agreement on key metrics. As a result, analytics became reactive—driven by stakeholder requests rather than strategy—making reporting high effort with low return.

**Business Profile:**
- Small to Medium Business in the E-commerce Industry
- Multiple internal teams (marketing, finance, ops) requiring Amazon marketplace data
- Growth & Marketplace Ops Team as key stakeholders

## Challenge

Without clear objectives or ownership, teams struggled to build dashboards that delivered real value. Different stakeholders pushed for conflicting metrics, planning was skipped, and KPIs weren't defined.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Polished dashboards with low adoption rates
- Fragmented efforts across multiple teams
- No clear direction on what to scale or prioritize
- Lack of standardized BI intake process
- Conflicting metric definitions between stakeholders
- No structured discovery or planning phase before dashboard development

## Solution

To meet stakeholder needs, the Brainforge team quickly delivered a segmented Amazon sales dashboard using Amplitude-style templates. While this sped up delivery, it also exposed gaps in BI ownership, lacked business context, and revealed fragmented efforts with no intake process.

**Solution Components:**

1. **Replicated Amplitude-style layout** to speed up delivery and provide familiar UX patterns
2. **Mapped and visualized Amazon sales by segment** for granular marketplace insights
3. **Context-driven BI through structured discovery** to ensure business alignment

**Technology Stack:**
- **Amplitude** – Analytics templates and UX patterns
- **Snowflake** – Cloud data warehouse
- **Fivetran** – Data integration and ETL
- **dbt** – Data transformation and modeling
- **Tableau** – Dashboard visualization and reporting
- **Google Docs** – Documentation and discovery briefs
- **Slack** – Team communication and collaboration
