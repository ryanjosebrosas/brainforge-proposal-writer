# From Manual Decks to Automated Storytelling

[START OF SECTION]
## Context

Interlude is a branding and fundraising studio that builds decks for founders and fund managers. Their process of building decks relied on questionnaires and interview transcripts, but the manual step of shaping those into a clear narrative often fell to the CEO himself. Their team was spending hours shaping narratives and formatting slides. This slowed delivery and distracted leadership from higher-value work, creating the need for a scalable AI-driven solution.

## Challenge

The creation process was slow, manual, and error-prone. Teams spent hours chasing PDFs, extracting insights, and reformatting content. Without a reliable evaluation pipeline, quality was hard to measure and AI adoption stalled. They needed a system that saved time without sacrificing clarity or client-ready polish. Key pain points included:

- Manual data entry and narrative shaping consumed leadership time
- No standardized process for extracting insights from questionnaires and transcripts
- Quality was inconsistent and difficult to measure
- Scaling the business required automating repetitive creative workflows

## Solution

Brainforge designed an AI-powered workflow using the Claude API, built around an orchestrator agent with specialized child agents that:

1. **Summarized input files and extracted key insights** — Processing questionnaires and interview transcripts automatically
2. **Created a clear narrative flow to structure presentations** — Ensuring consistent storytelling across all decks
3. **Automated formatting and quality checks** — Reducing manual review cycles
4. **Integrated a human-in-the-loop process** — Allowing the team to refine outputs and update evaluation metrics

The system was deployed directly into the team's existing workflow via Slack and Notion, enabling seamless adoption without disrupting established processes.

The AI agent responds with "Slide 1 — Opening" including headline "Rewiring the World: Unlocking the Next Generation of Electrification" with bullet points about advanced carbon nanomaterial conductors, 10x performance improvements, and multi-trillion dollar market opportunity. The agent provides sources, rationale, and positive feedback on the slide content.

**Technologies:**
- n8n for workflow orchestration
- Supabase for data storage
- Claude API for AI-powered content generation
- Braintrust for evaluation and monitoring
- Slack for user interface and collaboration
- Notion for documentation and output delivery

## Results

After implementation, the deck agent delivered significant improvements:

- **Faster deck first drafts** — Cut hours of manual work by producing a solid first draft in minutes (estimated 90% time reduction)
- **Clear, consistent narrative flow** — Each version arrives with a clear narrative flow, slide rationale, and feedback notes
- **Adoption and expansion** — The team can move faster without losing quality, enabling business growth

The system now produces client-ready deck outlines automatically, freeing leadership to focus on high-value strategic work rather than manual content creation. The workflow includes built-in quality metrics and evaluation pipelines to ensure consistent output quality.
